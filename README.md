## Introduction to Linux Kernel Development Assignments

This repo contains the class assignments and their associated resources.
Each assignment has its own folder. Generally you will be creating a folder
with your name inside of the assignment folder and doing your work there
then submitting patches of the resulting changes. For more details see the
specific assignment instructions as well as the assignment submission guidelines.

In this class there are two main kinds of coding assignments "exercises"
and "programs".

Exercises are named starting with `e0` and incrementing from there. These assignments
are about practicing skills and learning by doing. As a general rule you will
follow a series of instructions to execute certain commands, and answer questions
about what you did. Your submission will be proof that you completed the steps
correctly, and your answers to the questions. As a general rule exercises will
not involve much programming, and are weighted lesser in your overall grade.

Programs are named starting with `p0` and incrementing from there. These assignments
are about getting your hands dirty and actually writing some code. As a general rule
you will have specific requirements your code has to meet, and a way to test that
what you have written complete the requirements it successfully. Your submission
will consists of proof that your program works correctly, and its source code.
Since programs involve more actual coding, they will be weighted more in your overall grade.
