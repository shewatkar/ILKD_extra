Hello! I am Viet. I am a software engineer working on cloud applications at DellEMC.
I've been working with docker and kubernetes in many projects which triggers my curiousity about what features of linux kernel is behind such amazing tools.
And the more I get to know about linux kernel, the more I am fascinated about it. Therefore, I decided to take this class.

A fun fact about me: I am also a gymer.
