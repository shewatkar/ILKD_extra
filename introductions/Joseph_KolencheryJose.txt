I have very limited knowledge in Linux and Kernal development so I wanted to give this course an attempt.
Also want to try and understand the operating system. A lot of people suggested taking Prof.Bills courses.
His OS course was filled when I first tried for it so this was my only choice
I recently enrolled for the OS course as well and they are letting me do a 4th course 
this semester so im not dropping you guys. Please dont disappoint me boys xD. Just kidding!
Hope we have a good few months together.
My favourite icecream flavour is mango. Feel free to buy me one anytime. Not joking!
