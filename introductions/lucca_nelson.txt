Hello, my name is Lucca Nelson! I'm a senior undergrad student at UMass Lowell studying computer science!

My favorite passtime is the trading card game Magic: the Gathering. One fun fact about MtG is that,
despite being a card game, it's Turing Complete! Look up "mtg turing complete" if you want your brain melted!
